yarn dev

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/import?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

## Approach

Created API Component to store api
Created Constant component for static const or string (e.g. API urls to manage api urls, responsive size to manage size, filterOptions to manage filters, themes to manage colors and fonts).
Created Styled to use basic layout component like Container, Row, Col.
